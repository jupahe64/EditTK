# EditTK

EditTK is a Framework for 3D Level Editors or any kind of 3D Editor really, 
it's a spiritual successor to the [GL_EditorFramework](https://github.com/jupahe64/GL_EditorFramework) and will be used  for all future Editors (once it's done).
It makes heavy use of the [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) library.
The Frameworks graphics are powered by WebGPU and as such it supports Direct3D12, Vulkan and Metal (not tested yet).
And for UI it uses ImGUI ([ImGui.Net](https://github.com/ImGuiNET/ImGui.NET)).

It's currently being fully rewritten
